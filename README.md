### This is the home of random scripts/yamls, etc.. that I have collected over time, which have been useful and might continue to be useful in the future

### Folders:

#### Scripts

##### multipass

This folder contains scripts to start a quick 3 cluster node using multipass. The k8s uses "k3s" for a quick and simple setup. This is primarly used for testing and a way to quick start and stop a cluster on my local machine.
